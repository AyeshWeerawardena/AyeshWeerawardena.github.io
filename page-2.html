           _The reader is even, 
            <br>
            the writer is odd_.

            Remember that first car? <br>
            Not the first day--the day <br>
            after--when you'd waxed <br>
            that chrome, that baked enamel <br> 
            to a luster bright as the sky, <br>
            cleaned the old man's nicotine from the windows,
            <br>
            vacuumed, tossed out the under-dash deodorizer, 
            <br>
            installed the compass... <br>

            You get in: put your hands on the wheel, <br>
            fire it up. Coast down the block, <br>
            wave to Al Sylvester, let out <br>
            that long deep breath, <br>
            turn on the radio. <br>

            _Introibo ad altare Dei_: <br>
            where there is paper in plenty <br>
            & the ink flows like honey... <br>

          _Where did this pencil come from_? <br>
          the poem asks. Eleven black horses <br>
          ride across its white shaft. <br>
          A pencil from the racetrack. <br>
          What words could compete with this <br>
          grace, this frenzy of jockeys, <br>
          even their whips visible & <br>
          sharper than the tip of the pencil <br>
          in this race toward the eraser. <br>
          We're riding no words today: <br>
          this pencil's built for numbers. <br>
