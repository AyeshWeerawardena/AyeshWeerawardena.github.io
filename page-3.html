            A CONVERSATION WITH MARTIN HEIDEGGER

            <br><br><br><br><br><br>
            1
            <br><br>
            Brother Martin! Here? And you on my mind. <br>
            But you were drawn to poets. Rest by my hearth-- <br>
            an oddity now in this red-gothic maze.<br>
            <br><br>
            Looking into my blue flames we are soon gone, <br>
            our true selves staying in our work, <br>
            you say, as we easily fly back to Freiburg, <br>
            where by your pale fire, ten short years <br>
            after the uncovering, you sit still <br>
            "thinking back" on the glorious past <br>
            of Swabia--your corner of poverty-- <br>
            and I burn to ask about whoozit--the rector <br>
            whose place you took--and those you deposed. <br>
            <br><br>
            This all-things-bound-together-in-conflict, <br>
            you call true intimacy, and it holds us closer <br>
            to our own ground, as in undoing we do and in doing <br>
            we negate. I've no taste for your petite scandale; <br>
            we're discreet. Can I or my colleagues judge you?
            <br>
            Ambition, you say, means going around and around 
            <br>
            chasing your own tale. That's true, but we need <br>
            to know, also, as you root us all in being-there, <br>
            how you could breathe the infectious air, wherein <br>
            you grasped necessity and manfully cast yourself <br>
            into a broken iron cross, your most decisive <br>
            posture, making history possible with your gloss. <br>
            <br><br>
            When is subtlety sophistry; exposing pornography <br>
            the obscenity: the accuser the accused? Where <br>
            thought is calculative, you say, not meditative. <br>
            Excellent, Martin. I will remember.

            These shapes fill and hold long-violent days: <br>
            your home, Freiburg, the university, your hut here <br>
            in the Black Forest Mountains, Europe--half-patched <br>
            after the war-to-end-wars--that feudal bloodletting. <br>
            New tributaries to their old bloodstreams, England <br>
            and France backed thugs against the yearnings <br>
            of the long denied remnants of the Triple Kingdom <br>
            (careful not to displace tarty, perfumed auntie), <br>
            new paperdolls from ministries in Paris and London, <br>
            our Bureau still jostling anti-fascists in '42, <br>
            while our boys died, as still, for Latin puppets-- <br>
            cartoon figures with bald heads, mustaches <br>
            all shaping your thought, as it still scars ours, <br>
            garishly changed when your Dr. Goebbels said, <br>
            "Burn their books!" Blunt's my way, Martin.<br>
            <br><br>
            Later-- <br>
            charnel smoke shrouding Europe--you chat <br>
            about Holderlin's torn homecoming, over alps, <br>
            to folk, forest, field, both of you trapped in misty <br>
            nineteenth-century metaphors, dreaming a reunion, <br>
            Anschluss. <br>
            What part of that great green field <br>
            is our forty acres; what arc of that blue-eyed sky, <br>
            a friend asked, is home? <br>
            <br><br>
            Where the tongue splits <br>
            into poetry and politics, poetry, you say, <br>
            is silence, a comfort to many. Is this calculative, <br>
            Martin, this meditation, this silence?<br>

               3
               <br><br>
            After a decade when your thought drew <br>
            Europe's best--Sartre, Arendt (your own Jewess) <br>
            among them--you gave your voice to the dregs <br>
            of your crucible in their crucial year,<br>
            <br><br>
            then nurtured an endless silence <br>
            having led sheep for wolves sheep need, <br>
            you thought, to create new folds for sheep <br>
            lest sheep bleat and are eaten-- <br>
            bleats rising already in your alpine air.<br>
            <br><br>
            Yet you must have been comfortable when you said <br>
            poets name gods and all things as what they are, <br>
            not merely tagging those already known-- <br>
            a conversation in the chambers and corridors <br>
            of the word. In speaking the necessary word, <br>
            we name things, and the named becomes known--or hidden: <br>
            you censored your earlier mentions of Husserl. <br>
            We give birth to being through the word, <br>
            our silences stretching catholic wastes around it. <br>
            <br><br>
            We are comfortable, with many fine poets, too. <br>
            But in some situations, I want to say, <br>
            Beautiful bullshit, Martin. <br>
            <br><br>
            Truth can lie. <br>
            God's sakes, Spit it out! <br>
            <br><br>
            Poor Holderlin, mad, <br>
            foreseeing his sublime made wormy, Kierkegaard <br>
            gasping at our stripped age, Nietzsche <br>
            trying to shake us awake <br>
            <br><br>
            our poets in asylums <br>
            and jails. Lobotomies, lost connections. <br>

            The names my tongue can't say aren't those who, <br>
            in your way, still chart our universities false. <br>
            I want to know what warps we tunnel through, <br>
            from knowing these unnameables, to pursue our <br>
            daily pretensions, our standards for living? <br>

            <br><br>

            Martin, we endow ironed white shirts still; <br>
            decade on decade: wherever peace bonds kill <br>
            today. Feds harassing journalists and scholars <br>
            for trying to sing with the authors of liberty <br>
            the only thing that can save us or others, <br>
            here, in Managua, Soweto, or Port-au-Prince, <br>
            where bodies strangely grow from dirt or asphalt, <br>
            our fingerprints in the lead roots of red flowers. <br>
            Protesting students threatened in quiet nights <br>
            deans and their tails wag out deja vu Edgar's <br>
            boys called integrationists Red in the fifties)-- <br>
            we too make non-persons of those who protest-- <br>
            as our president, all-cap smile and tinted hair, <br>
            shrugs and talks of freedom, our own barmy <br>
            Wagnerian stagehand--where the Emancipator sat-- <br>
            killing another's revolution, as Chrysler remodels <br>
            Liberty by The Book of 0, making her a fancy lady <br>
            for United Fruit, cavities stretched <br>
            until tanks drive through: the foreplay of war. <br>
            The President of the Screen Actors, playing SS <br>
            for the Bureau, prescribed capsules to metabolize <br>
            terror in our bloodstream, where his U-boat rises, <br>
            sliding up the Potomac toward the lake of ice <br>
            at the core, his leading lady gliding at his side, <br>
            nothing real but costumes, roles, of make-out, <br>
            made-up evangelists who give directions while <br>
            writing a mad play where the electors are extras <br>

            A-NOTE
            <br><br>
            Van K. Brock has a BA from Emory University and graduate degrees from
            the University of Iowa and the Writers' Workshop. Since 1970, he has
            taught at Florida State University, where he is a Professor of English
            and a former director of the Writing Program. <br>
            Even before his first book, in 1927, the young lecturer Heidegger was
            highly acclaimed. In 1933, when Goebbels called for burning books by
            Jews, socialists, and others, in bonfires often fed by professors and
            students, Heidegger swore loyalty to Hitler and, by vote of the faculty,
            replaced the dissenting rector at Freiburg. Always a German nationalist,
            Heidegger headed the movement to unite workers and students into the
            Party and signed orders firing Jewish professors, one of whom, Werner
            Brock, later an editor-interpreter of Heidegger, claimed Heidegger could
            do nothing else. When Hitler wanted him in Munich in 1933 and Berlin in
            1935, Heidegger remained at Freiburg, and after 1934 Heidegger resigned
            as rector, pleading too much political influence. His fervent support of
            Nazis during the year he was rector was given when their power was
            weakest, but investigations by the French after the war cleared him of
            war crimes. <br>
            Among Heidegger's loyal followers, Sartre (who read Heidegger and
            Husserl in Berlin) was in the Resistance and a Nazi prison, and Hannah
            Arendt (once Heidegger's student and lover), in exile in New York,
            became an influential philosopher of community and justice. If some deem
            Heidegger the thinker of his time, others find him original but
            untenable. He based his thought in a concept of rooted relation he
            called being-there, and stood on it by staying in Freiburg, even when it
            meant severing thought from action.
