            TWELVE OF ONE

            THE UPPER HAND
            <br><br>
            There's anger <br>
            but he keeps it <br>
            in certain places <br>
            If he loses <br>
            his hand <br>
            it does things <br>
            and they hurt <br>
            So he holds it <br>
            with his other <br>

            TURTLE KNOWLEDGE
            <br><br>
            They stand over me<br>
            deciding what to do<br>
            The older boy with the stick<br>
            jabs at my underbelly<br>
            to see if I bend<br>
            I have pulled into myself<br>
            pretending I am not here<br>
            <br><br>
            If they leave me on my back<br>
            I will become stone<br>
            a part of these woods<br>
            that does not move forever<br>
            that will outlast small menaces<br>
            <br><br>
            Soon they will be called home<br>
            to greasy steaks and tater tots<br>
            To their domain<br>
            of blurred screens<br>
            in dusty trailer parks<br>
            still not knowing<br>
            how things work<br>
            <br><br>
            On my back and defenseless<br>
            I am everything<br>
            that escapes<br>

            DANGER ZONES
            <br><br>
            1.
            <br><br>
            Your heart is flying, he said<br>
            his weight against her chest<br>
            It does that, she said<br>
            drawing him in<br>
            <br><br>
            2.
            <br><br>
            You walked me along<br>
            your perfected edges<br>
            taking me in your stride<br>
            A fool for interiors<br>
            I asked to be let in<br>
            This will not hurt, I promised<br>
            Just you wait, you said<br>
            <br><br>
            3.
            <br><br>
            We shouldn't do this<br>
            she says<br>
            I know, I know<br>
            he answers<br>
            pulling her back down<br>
            under the crumpled sheets<br>
            <br>
            And it would have been perfect<br>
            if it could have been<br>
            completely different<br>

            FEAST OF PRISONERS IN A MEADOW NEAR LONELINESS
            <br><br>
            Singling one out and laying it on her palm
            the root of the weed is a surprise to her.
            I didn't know there was so much to them, she says
            as he turns over on his side
            his back to her.
            People, she says
            have fed off such things
            Prisoners, for instance, with nothing
            better to live on.
            Maybe it was the root that sustained them
            not the thorny leaves, surely
            but what was underneath
            a reason to put your hands
            deeper into dirt.
            Imagine it--fields and fields of people
            digging into things, digging
            into people, always digging

            your meaning thick, garbled <br>

            things."
